# Info

This is my current setup which is using xmonad as a base. A list of keybinds is WIP (Open it if installed with Mod+F12). Feel free to fork it and do sth cool out of it, you don't need to give credits but I would be happy about it. üòÅ

## Material U(nix)

If you have ever used android 12 or up you are familiar with [material you](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you). For those who don't know, it basically changes all the colors on your display to some from your wallpaper. To use it press F12 > Change Themes > Material You or use material-you.sh in .xmonad. Feel free to adapt this script to your rice. I would love to see someone using it. It can only handle .jpg and .png files for now.

## Change Themes

To change Themes use the Python Programm. If the dotfiles are installed use F12 on your keyboard. A simple python3 ./configuration.py should also do it. Changing the Themes for GTK will come in the Programm soon, but its also possible to cahange it thorugh lxapperance.

## Make Themes

To make your own theme run 
```
~/.xmonad/generate-theme.sh [COLOR1] [COLOR2] [COLOR3] [COLOR4] [NAME]
```

* COLOR1: The color for the background of the bar
* COLOR2: Foreground color of the bar
* COLOR3: Active window color
* COLOR4: Inactive window color
* NAME: Name of the theme

All the colors have to be in hex code but WITHOUT THE #


Example:
```
~/.xmonad/generate-theme.sh 2E3440 B48EAD 5E81AC A3BE8C NordTheme
```
## Uninstall selfmade Themes

To remove your generated themes from [above](https://github.com/Ftamino/dotfiles/edit/main/README.md#make-themes) run
```
~/.xmonad/generate-theme.sh -r [NAME]
```
Use the exact NAME as [above](https://github.com/Ftamino/dotfiles/edit/main/README.md#make-themes)

## Others:
 1. Use your package manager to install dependences (if u dont use the flatpak of flameshot you have to change the hotkey action for it in the xmonad config)
 ```
 xmonad polybar neofetch lxpolkit dunst rofi picom copyq volumeicon nitrogen emacs kitty git flameshot arandr
 ```
 2. Download the repo
