# Info

This is my current setup which is using xmonad as a base. A list of keybinds is WIP (Open it if installed with Mod+F12). Feel free to fork it and do sth cool out of it, you don't need to give credits but I would be happy about it. üòÅ

## Change Themes

To change Themes use the Python Programm. If the dotfiles are installed use F12 on your keyboard. A simple python3 ./configuration.py should also do it. Changing the Themes for GTK will come in the Programm soon, but its also possible to cahange it thorugh lxapperance.

## Make Themes

To make your own theme just go into .xmonad/lib/colors and copy one of the .hs files. Give it a new name and change in line 1 behind "Colors." the eg Standart to the name of your file. In line five to the same. Change the scheme in xmonad.hs in the imports section by changing the argument import Colors.Standart to the name of yours.
